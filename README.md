# Project Decription
This was my first project that I uploaded onto GitHub. It was created during my freshman year of college and is a Snake game. 
This game was programmed in Eclipse using Java Swing. In the game, the snake eats a nutritious mushroom to grow. 
However, there are three other types of mushrooms: one is deadly to the snake, another slows down its movement, 
and the third shortens the snake's length.
